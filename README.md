# Quick Start: Data Storage API (Node.js/Express.js) :turtle::rocket:

Implementing a small HTTP service in Node.js/Express.js to store objects organized by repository.
Clients of this service should be able to `GET`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` objects and Unit Testing.

## API

### Upload an Object

```
PUT /data/{repository}
```

#### Response

```
Status: 201 Created
{
  "oid": "2845f5a412dbdfacf95193f296dd0f5b2a16920da5a7ffa4c5832f223b03de96",
  "size": 1234
}
```

### Download an Object

```
GET /data/{repository}/{objectID}
```

#### Response

```
Status: 200 OK
{object data}
```

Objects that are not on the server will return a `404 Not Found`.

### Delete an Object

```
DELETE /data/{repository}/{objectID}
```

#### Response

```
Status: 200 OK
```

## Getting started and Testing

This exercise requires a recent version of Node.js. Get started by installing dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

Write your server implementation in `server.js`. Then run the tests:

```sh
npm test
```

Or run them continuously as you work:

```sh
npm run test-watch
```
